                How will <em>interfaces</em> look like in the future? Even though we do not have an answer to this question just yet, we can discuss what characteristics interfaces might have. 
                In my opinion, I’m sure that we will eventually move away from interfaces full of menus, panels, buttons, and move towards more ‘natural interfaces’, i.e. interfaces 
                that extend our bodies. The interfaces of the future will not be locked in a physical screen, but instead they will use the power of all five senses. Because of that, 
                they will require a less learning curve — ideally, no learning curve at all.
                Products that use voice as the primary interface are becoming more and more popular. Many of us use Amazon Echo and Apple Siri for daily routine activities such 
                as setting an alarm clock or making an appointment. But a majority of voice interaction systems available on the market today still have a natural limitation: 
                they do not take user emotions into account.
